# Project Setup Guide

## About package-lock.json

### What is package-lock.json?

The `package-lock.json` file is a **lock file** that was automatically generated by npm (Node Package Manager) when you installed dependencies for your project. 

**Purpose**: It ensures consistent, reproducible builds by "locking" the exact versions of all dependencies and their sub-dependencies that were installed.

### Key Features

- **Exact versions**: Unlike `package.json` which can specify version ranges (like `^3.9.1`), this file locks the exact versions
- **Dependency tree**: It contains the complete dependency tree with resolved versions
- **Integrity checks**: Each package has a SHA integrity hash to verify it hasn't been tampered with
- **Automatic generation**: Created automatically when you run `npm install`

### Why did it appear?

This file appeared because:
1. You have a `package.json` file with dependencies (React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, etc.)
2. You ran `npm install` to install these dependencies
3. npm automatically generated this lock file to ensure consistent installations

### Should you commit it?

**Yes, you should commit this file!** Here's why:
- **Team consistency**: Ensures everyone on your team gets the exact same dependency versions
- **Deployment reliability**: Guarantees your production builds use the same versions as development
- **Security**: The integrity hashes help prevent supply chain attacks

### What's in your file?

Your `package-lock.json` shows you're working on a Next.js project with:
- React 19
- Next.js 15.2.4
- Tailwind CSS
- Various Radix UI components
- TypeScript support

The file is quite large (4,581 lines) because it contains the complete dependency tree for all your packages and their sub-dependencies.

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (version 18.17.0 or higher)
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
   - Verify installation: `node --version`

2. **npm** (comes with Node.js)
   - Verify installation: `npm --version`

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd v0-front-end
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This command will:
   - Read the `package.json` file
   - Install all dependencies listed
   - Generate/update the `package-lock.json` file
   - Create a `node_modules` folder with all packages

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the Next.js development server, typically on `http://localhost:3000`

### Available Scripts

Based on your project setup, you likely have these npm scripts available:

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run type-check` - Run TypeScript type checking

### Project Structure

Your project appears to be a modern Next.js application with:

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 15.2.4
- **UI Library**: React 19
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Radix UI components
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Theming**: Next Themes
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)

## Supabase Database Setup

### Database Schema

Your project includes a comprehensive startup ecosystem database with 10 tables:

**Core Tables:**
1. **users** - User accounts and profiles
2. **investment_firms** - Venture capital firms and investors
3. **investment_funds** - Specific investment funds
4. **startups** - Startup companies and their details
5. **funding_rounds** - Investment rounds and funding events
6. **people** - Founders, investors, and team members
7. **news** - News articles and updates

**Junction Tables:**
8. **funding_round_participants** - Links investors to funding rounds
9. **startup_team_members** - Links people to startups
10. **news_startup_relations** - Links news to startups

### Setting Up Supabase Connection

1. **Get your Supabase credentials**:
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings â†’ API
   - Copy your Project URL and anon/public key

2. **Create environment variables**:
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local file in your project root
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```

3. **Add your Supabase credentials to `.env.local`**:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the database schema**:
   - Copy the contents of `Supabase_schema_and_sampledata/hybrid_schema_10_tables.sql`
   - Run it in your Supabase SQL editor
   - Optionally run the sample data: `Supabase_schema_and_sampledata/hybrid_sample_data_10_tables.sql`

### Database Connection Files

The project includes:

- **`lib/supabase.ts`** - Supabase client configuration with TypeScript types
- **`components/StartupCard.tsx`** - Reusable component for displaying startup data
- **`app/startups/page.tsx`** - Example page showing startups from database
- **`app/database-demo/page.tsx`** - Demo page to explore all database tables

### Using the Database in Components

```typescript
import { db } from '@/lib/supabase'

// Fetch startups
const { data: startups, error } = await db.startups.getPublic()

// Fetch investment firms
const { data: firms, error } = await db.investmentFirms.getAll()

// Search startups
const { data: results, error } = await db.startups.search('AI')
```

### Database Helper Functions

The `lib/supabase.ts` file includes helper functions for common operations:

- **Startups**: `getAll()`, `getById()`, `getPublic()`, `search()`, `getByIndustry()`, `getByStage()`
- **Investment Firms**: `getAll()`, `getById()`, `getByType()`, `search()`
- **Funding Rounds**: `getAll()`, `getByStartup()`, `getRecent()`
- **People**: `getAll()`, `getById()`, `getByRole()`, `search()`
- **News**: `getAll()`, `getFeatured()`, `getByType()`, `getRecent()`

### Troubleshooting

#### If you encounter issues:

1. **Clear node_modules and reinstall**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. **Check Node.js version**:
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
   Make sure it's 18.17.0 or higher

3. **Clear npm cache**:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

4. **Check for port conflicts**:
   If port 3000 is in use, Next.js will automatically try the next available port

5. **Database connection issues**:
   - Verify your Supabase credentials in `.env.local`
   - Check that your database schema has been applied
   - Ensure your Supabase project is active and not paused

### Git Workflow

1. **Always commit package-lock.json**:
   ```bash
   git add package-lock.json
   git commit -m "Update dependencies"
   ```

2. **When pulling changes**:
   ```bash
   git pull
   npm install  # Install any new dependencies
   ```

3. **Environment variables**:
   - Never commit `.env.local` (it's in `.gitignore`)
   - Share the `env.example` file with your team
   - Each developer should create their own `.env.local`

### Environment Variables

If your project uses environment variables, you'll need to create a `.env.local` file in the root directory. Check if there's a `.env.example` file for reference.

### Additional Notes

- The `package-lock.json` file should never be manually edited
- If you need to update dependencies, use `npm update` or `npm install <package-name>@<version>`
- The file is automatically regenerated when you run `npm install`
- Always commit this file to version control for team consistency
- The Supabase client is configured with full TypeScript support
- Database operations are optimized with proper error handling
- The project includes example components showing how to use the database
